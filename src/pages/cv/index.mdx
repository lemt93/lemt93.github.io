  - Analyzing new requirements to prepare a new proposal, and the result is that we won a new contract with DP.
  - Implementing base structure: define base services, models and how should components interact with each other.
  - Integrated JointJS model into Ember model, resulted in better data synchronization and render/update performance for SVG elements.
  - Working mostly with the data layer in Ember: collaborate with BE developers to define APIs, define models and relationships between them.
  - Analyzing risks in grooming/planning, provide solutions for technical challenged tasks.
  - Identifying and resolve blocker issues, ensure the team follows the defined process right.

#### Core - Revegy
(*July 2016 – Oct 2018*) --- **FE Engineer**
  - Working independently and effectively with assigned tasks, clarify requirements with QA and BA if needed.
  - Using Ember and JointJS to implement intensive interaction feature, such as: draw org chart and allow user to interact with it (drag/drop/update attributes)
  - Was able to resolve render performance issues by removing unnecessary DOM access on data changed (even accessing some DOM props could cause reflow/layout)!

#### Internal tools of KMS
(*May 2016 – July 2016*) --- **FE Engineer**
  - Improve React/HighchartJS render performance

#### Launch program of KMS
(*March 2016 - May 2016*) --- **Intern/Trainee**
